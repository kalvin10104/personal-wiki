        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>Programming is the process of designing and building software by writing code in languages like</p>
        <p>Python, Java, and C++. It enables computers to perform specific tasks, solve problems, and automate</p>
            <p>processes. Programming requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of</p>
                <p>algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s used across fields such as web development, data science,</p>
                    <p>artificial intelligence, and game development. By learning to program, individuals can create</p>
                        <p>applications, websites, and tools that improve efficiency and productivity. As technology advances,</p>
                            <p>programming skills continue to be essential in shaping the digital world and driving innovation</p>
                                <p>across industries.</p>
