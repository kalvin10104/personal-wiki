        <h2>Linux</h2>
        
        <p>Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It</p>
            <p>powers a wide range of devices, from personal computers and servers to smartphones and</p>
                <p>embedded systems. Unlike proprietary systems, Linux offers users freedom to modify, distribute, and</p>
                    <p>customize its source code. This has led to a vibrant community and a vast ecosystem of distributions,</p>
                        <p>such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS, each tailored for different needs. With strong support for</p>
                            <p>programming, networking, and system administration, Linux is a popular choice for developers and</p>
                                <p>IT professionals. Itâ€™s also the backbone of most of the internet.</p>
